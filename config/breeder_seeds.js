Most girls collected fashion magazines, I collected dog magazines.  When I was 21, I went to my first dog show with a lady who had french Bulldogs and Mastiffs.  I would go over and learn about breeding, showing and dogs in general.  She was my first mentor.  Then came the time for me to get my first purebred dog.  I got a Siberian Husky.  He couldn't be shown because someone left the litter at a grooming facility. So he was AKC PAL registered.  We then began the road of learning obedience.  As with any of our first dogs, we often make mistakes with training.  Well Ynuk was no different.  Together we climbed the ladder of training until I was to the point of becoming a licensed dog trainer.  I began training clients in home settings and volunteering at a local no kill shelter to train dogs for adoption.  ",
